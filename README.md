  <h2>About the Project :house_with_garden:	</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to our project repository! Here, we embark on a journey into the realm of supervised regression in machine learning, coupled with rigorous data cleaning, wrangling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Our endeavor focuses on constructing a robust predictor for house sale prices within King County, encompassing Seattle, covering a period from May 2014 to May 2015.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Objective:</h3>
  <p>
    Our primary objective is to develop a reliable predictive model capable of estimating house sale prices based on a comprehensive dataset brimming with pertinent information about various properties within King County.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Methodology:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> We commence by meticulously cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure the integrity and reliability of our subsequent analyses.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Wrangling:</strong> Following data cleaning, we engage in data wrangling activities, transforming and structuring the data to facilitate efficient model training and evaluation.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Through EDA, we delve deep into the dataset, unraveling insights, patterns, and correlations that may inform feature selection and model development.</li>
    <li><strong>Supervised Regression:</strong> Leveraging the power of supervised learning algorithms, we construct regression models capable of predicting house sale prices.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Project Structure :open_file_folder:</h2>

<p>
  This project is developed through three notebooks.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/TonioDominguez/Ironkaggle/blob/main/code/ironkaggle_set_up.ipynb">IRONKAGGLE SET UP:</a></strong> In this initial notebook, we focus on extracting data, standardizing them for good practice, and conducting preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) to grasp the underlying patterns of the information.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/TonioDominguez/Ironkaggle/blob/main/code/default_modeling.ipynb">DEFAULT MODELING:</a></strong> In the second notebook, our efforts are concentrated on data preprocessing and commencing the journey towards final modeling. We explore various supervised regression models to identify the most suitable candidate for our predictive modeling task.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/TonioDominguez/Ironkaggle/blob/main/code/improved_modeling.ipynb">IMPROVED MODELING:</a></strong> As the title suggests, the third notebook entails refining and structuring the final dataframe to facilitate the implementation of our machine learning predictor model. Here, we take strides towards enhancing the efficacy and performance of our predictive model.
